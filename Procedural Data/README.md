Abstract:
The use of real-time 3D to generate procedural data, the rendering of games, cinematics, and images photo realistically with shader-based labeling, has the potential to revolutionize computer vision. Any data that can be imagined can be produced for training of deep learning models. In particular, visual data for underrepresented groups, rare diseases, or any data bias can be created to improve the accuracy and fairness of models. In this paper we use Blenderproc to generate procedural data and compare it to the Cityscapes benchmarks. We demonstrate that very high-quality computer vision data can be created using real-time 3D tools.

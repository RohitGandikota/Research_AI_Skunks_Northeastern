## Comparison of Performance and Best Practices of Data Imputation Techniques

### Abstract ðŸ“‘

Missing data is common problem faced by researchers and data scientists. Therefore, it is
required to handle them appropriately to get better and accurate results out of the machine
leaning models. The Objective of this study is to determine the best data imputation methods
and to assess the performance of the widely used data imputation methods for Numeric and
Categorical dataset. In this study we comprehensively compare five data imputation methods
namely mean imputation, median imputation, mode imputation, K â€“ Nearest Neighbors
(KNN) and Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE). The performance of the data
imputation methods is assessed using Standardized Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for
numeric data and column wise average accuracy for One-Hot-Encoded categorical data.

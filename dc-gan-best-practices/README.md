## Comparison of Performance and Best Practices of Data Imputation Techniques

### Abstract ðŸ“‘

GAN training can be tricky and very senstive. It is still an active research domain to achieve a stable and consistent training method for GANs. 
This project focuses on DC-GANs and the best practices that can be followed for a stable GAN training.
We particularly dive into the hyperparamters and explore architectural choices. \par
We also plan to extend the project to explore whether one can control the output of DC-GANs and also achieve disentanglement in DC-GANs. 
We compare various architecures and designs of DC-GANs and arrive at a recommendable desgin for stable training.

## Comparison of Performance and Best Practices of Data Imputation Techniques

### Abstract ðŸ“‘

GAN training can be tricky and very sensitive. It is still an active research domain to achieve a stable and consistent training method for GANs.
This project focuses on DC-GANs and the best practices that can be followed for stable GAN training. We particularly dive into the hyperparameters and explore architectural choices. <br>
We also plan to extend the project to explore whether one can control the output of DC-GANs and also achieve disentanglement in DC-GANs.
We compare various architectures and designs of DC-GANs and arrive at a recommendable design for stable training.
